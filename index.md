# Standard Documents
## What are Standard Documents?
Standard Documents are documents, forms, and contracts with a fixed shape. They
allow you to change some variables but lock the rest in place. They provide
a common ground for everyone. We spend less time discussing arbitrary style
issue and more the goals of the document.

## FAQ
### Are Standard Documents the same as templates?
No! You can use them as templates but that's not the goal. By everyone agreeing
on only changing the variables of a standard document, everyone is able to
move faster. The goal is to focus on the variables, not the structure of the
document.

If you do use a standard document as a template, please remove any branding.
The branding should only be used when sticking to only modifying the variables.

### I disagree with the wording a Standard Document
Please don't use it as a template and modify it. Every Standard Document has a
group of maintainers. Reach out to them. As the world changes, Standard Documents
will evolve with different versions.

### How's this similar to software?
In software, to re-use a bit of code you can either copy/paste it or use a library.
In most cases, you want to use a library. This makes the code easier to read and
maintain. Standard Documents are the libraries where templates are the copy/paste.
